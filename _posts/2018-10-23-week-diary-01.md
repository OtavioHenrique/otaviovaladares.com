This is a new series of posts, I'll try to show the best posts that I've read during the period (my intention is to be once a week), and talk about my studies, but obviously, only tech related things.

## Summary

**Week: 2018-10-15 to 2018-10-22**

As usual, this week I read many posts about things that I'm following, and I'm working on writing two new posts that I'll explain below. I started to read a new book about lisp and I finished a nice python book that I'll explain too.

## Books

- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Al Sweigart
This week I finished this book, it's a book recommended for novices, for me, it's a good book for beginners, but for people who already know how to program in other dynamic and interpreted programming language, I think is not necessary to read this book, go ahead an read something more advanced. This week I'll post my review of this book, I'll try to write reviews and this book will be my test.

- Land of Lisp, Conrad Barski
I bought this book along with the previous at a Humble Bundle (I paid $15), this book was already at my wish list, when I say it at this price I bought. I'm loving this book, but I am only in the middle of this book, when I finish, I'll write about It. But my first impressions about Lisp is: It's a nice and simple language, I expect to learn a lot from it.

## Posts

This week I worked on a few posts:

- Review of  Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart as I described above (I'll publish this week)
- I translated my post about Big O notation to my native language (Portuguese) and I'll post on a Brazillian blog soon.
- I'm working on a blog post about my nvim/vim setup, with plugins and `.bashrc`
