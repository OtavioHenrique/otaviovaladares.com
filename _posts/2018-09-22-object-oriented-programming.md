Undoubtedly object oriented programming is one of the most important topics in computer science. Why? Because it's the most used paradigm of computer programming, market still using object oriented programming, and in my opinion, it wil not stop using soon.

On this post I'll talk about a top-level view of the theory behind object oriented programming, the intention here isn't write a lot of code, but to understand what is object oriented programming, what is object and start having an object-oriented thinking.

In my opinion, this post isn't only for beginners, this post can be very useful for beginners but experienced programmers can extract or remember good things here, with time, we forgot things, and at this point is good for back to basic and remember some theory behind the things.

## The history

*Warning: I know that some people don't want to read about the history of OOP, if you are this people, skip this topic.*

The modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at MIT in the late 1950s and early 1960s, "object" could refer to LISP atoms with properties.

#### Simula

But the first time that world heard about something like OOP was with [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula), it was the first object oriented language, as its name suggests it was used to create simulations, and the needs of that domain provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today.

Simula was developed to build computational models of real world objects with behavior and data and make simulations with these objects, when [Kristen Nygaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Nygaard) and [Ole-Johan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole-Johan_Dahl) created Simula, they were working with simulations envolving exploding ships.

Simula introduced traditional OOP concepts like objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses.

It's important to remeber that at this time, the term "object oriented programming" was not used to describe it.
