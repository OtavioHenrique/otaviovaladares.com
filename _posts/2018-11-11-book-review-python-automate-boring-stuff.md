A few weeks ago I finished to read "Automate the boring stuff with Python" from Al Sweigart, on this review I'll try to make a good review of the book and talk about the main chapters.

## Print / Publisher

The book publisher is the famous [no starch press](https://nostarch.com/), that have a lot of famous books like:

- [Ruby Under a Microscope](https://nostarch.com/rum)
- [Clojure for the Brave and Tru](https://nostarch.com/clojure)
- [Clojure for the Brave and Tru](https://nostarch.com/clojure)
- [Land of Lisp](https://nostarch.com/lisp.htm)
- [Black Hat Python](https://nostarch.com/blackhatpython)

And much more, I think every experienced programmer knows nostarch very well because the have a lot of famous and good books, if you are a beginner, you can trust on them.

I didn't have the physical edition of this book, I've read the digital edition on my Kindle Paperwhite, read technical books on digital readers is always it's always a fear because some books don't looks good at the small screens, specially the code snippets, but this was not the problem of this book, I think large publishers like nostarch or O'relly you'll never going to have this problem.

The physical editon I think should be excellent too because I have other books from nostarch and no one disappointed me.
