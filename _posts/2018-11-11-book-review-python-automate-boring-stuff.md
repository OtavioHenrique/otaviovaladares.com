A few weeks ago I finished to read "Automate the boring stuff with Python" from Al Sweigart, on this review I'll try to make a good review of the book and talk about the main chapters.

It's a book recommended for novices, for me, it's a good book for beginners, but for people who already know how to program in other dynamic and interpreted programming language, I think is not necessary to read this book, go ahead an read something more advanced.

TL;DR: If you know how to program in another interpreted programming language like Ruby, go ahead and read something more advanced, if you are a beginner, start with this book, it's a very good book to start coding.

## Print / Publisher

The book publisher is the famous [no starch press](https://nostarch.com/), that have a lot of famous books like:

- [Ruby Under a Microscope](https://nostarch.com/rum)
- [Clojure for the Brave and Tru](https://nostarch.com/clojure)
- [Clojure for the Brave and Tru](https://nostarch.com/clojure)
- [Land of Lisp](https://nostarch.com/lisp.htm)
- [Black Hat Python](https://nostarch.com/blackhatpython)

And much more, I think every experienced programmer knows nostarch very well because the have a lot of famous and good books, if you are a beginner, you can trust on them.

I didn't have the physical edition of this book, I've read the digital edition on my Kindle Paperwhite, read technical books on digital readers is always it's always a fear because some books don't looks good at the small screens, specially the code snippets, but this was not the problem of this book, I think large publishers like nostarch or O'relly you'll never going to have this problem.

The physical editon I think should be excellent too, because I have other books from nostarch and no one disappointed me.

## Content

The book is divided on two parts, the first one talks about all the basic things of any programming language like, variables, loops, ifs/elses and etc. This part is good to understand the basic of python. This part covers all between variables and manipulate text.

The second part and the most interesting show you how to automate boring stuffs with python on a simple way, at this part you develop a lot of applications, for example reading Excel documents. This part have eleven chapters, talking about a lot of things, this is the best part on my opinion, the author shows you how to do a lot of cool things like web scraping :)
